Replit link https://replit.com/@OscarZhong1/Quiz#main.py
## couldnt change the name from main to quiz_game.py without replit breaking

from timeit import default_timer as timer 
## so the first line of code imports default timer from timeit module

def new_game():
  intro = "Welcome to the Group G pub quiz"
  print(intro.center(60, "*"))
  name = input("\nInput your name here:")
## Defines a function called new_game() then it prints the variable intro in the centre with * on either side

  print("Welcome to the Group G pub quiz", name,
